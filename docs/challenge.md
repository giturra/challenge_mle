## Gitflow methodology

In order to code all parts of the challenge, I followed the gitflow workflow. For each new feature added to the project, I created a new branch with the naming convention `feature/<brief-description>`, where `<brief-description>` describes in a few words the new feature added to the project. Once a `feature/<brief-description>` branch was finished, it was merged into the develop branch to keep it updated. Finally, when the development of the project was finished, the `develop` branch was merged into the `main` branch, which is the official branch, to release the official version of the project.

However, in a correct gitflow methodology, it is necessary to create a pull request before adding a new feature to the `develop` branch. When the code reviewer approves the changes, these changes are merged into the `develop` branch. These steps were omitted in order to save development time. I just created a pull request to merge the `develop` branch into the `main` branch and create the release version.
